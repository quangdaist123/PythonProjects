# PythonProjects
If only I had started using GitHub sooner.
I'm on the verge of finishing a Python course for beginner on Udemy (Complete Python Bootcamp). During the course, I've done some simple projects like Tic Tac Toe game, Black Jack game,...
I feel like I'm getting along with coding and want to push my work further by keeping my progress in a neat place, which is why I learn to use GitHub.
From now I will upload my Python projects on this repo and see if I can make any improvement when I look at them somewhere in the future
Yay
